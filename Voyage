1) Text: "In a deployed application, there should be no need to close or reset the connection to the database"
I am not a native speaker but for me this words are to week.
We should stronlgy warn to do this/exactly explain what happens if someone does this and already has references in the image to some objects in the cache.
-> In this case, a new cache is created and the object in the old cache seems to be another one. If saving the object in the new cache, it is doubled.
Perhaps add some sentences explaining how the cache works. There have been some discussions about it in slack, mails and nabble about this.
It would be useful to summarize it/explain it. (I suffered a lot from it, took much time because I did not understand what VORepository current reset does)

Voyage
Feedback on its installation and use:

- MongoDB get installed and running easily
- Get a hard time installing it from the official configuration browser, it required an update to Seaside which in turn does not work. Fight for a couple of days to get it installed.http://forum.world.st/Latest-Voyage-for-Pharo4-tp4934769p4935335.html
- Got hanging Voyage, need to use the latest version and not the one from the Configuration browser http://forum.world.st/Voyage-hang-tp4935341.html
- Instance will not synchronize between several Voyage repository: you need to stick to one repo or use id to link data between repo, like good old Sql http://forum.world.st/Voyage-Unique-vs-Multiple-repo-tt4935133.html
- Get back an object to its repository value, not sure about this one http://forum.world.st/Voyage-refreshing-an-object-back-to-its-repository-state-tp4935881.html
- Have difficulties to iterate over a fetched object attributes, to me Voyage does not behave as expected http://forum.world.st/Voyage-and-instances-retrieving-tt4936868.html. Here is a test to expose the problem http://forum.world.st/Test-for-Voyage-failure-to-materialize-in-some-situation-tt4938014.html
- Got a one day shift when saving/loading a date http://forum.world.st/Voyage-and-Date-tp4937235.html
- Meet broken class, not sure what it is about http://forum.world.st/Voyage-VOToOneDescription-or-VOMongoToOneDescription-tp4936998.html
- Association and dictionary need to be on elementary form with key a string and value a numeric, otherwise you can not save it. There is a work around http://forum.world.st/Voyage-and-Association-tt4936673.html#a4936694
- Scaled Decimal will mostly not be persisted. If you are doing arithmetic computing and exact value is needed, you will end with a too large integer error from Voyage (for the fraction den/num representing your exact value). You have no choice but to use float http://forum.world.st/Voyage-and-Scaled-decimal-tt4936625.html
- Voyage singleton repository and Seaside are reported to work together just fine http://forum.world.st/Voyage-and-seaside-tt4935946.html
- When editing and saving a client model, I got a duplicated object in the Participant collection. http://forum.world.st/Voyage-and-duplicated-entry-tt4937268.html
- You need an adaptor for your Date attributes: to convert back from the DateAndTime saved form in Mongo http://forum.world.st/Voyage-save-Date-get-back-DateAndTime-bug-tt4703601.html, but there is issue with a shifted date of one day, really!?
